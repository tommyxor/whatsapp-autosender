# WhatsApp Auto-Sender

This Node.js application automates the process of sending WhatsApp messages using the WhatsApp Business API. It sends templated messages to a list of recipients based on their status.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js
- A WhatsApp Business API client
- An `.env` file with the following variables set:
  - `WHATSAPP_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the WhatsApp API.
  - `ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your WhatsApp API access token.
  - `TEMPLATE_NAME`: Your WhatsApp message template name

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tommyxor/whatsapp-autosender.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd whatsapp-autosender
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

1. Add your recipient data to `test-data.json` in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "phoneNumber": "123456789",
    "invitationName": "John Doe",
    "status": "pending"
  }
  // ... more entries
]
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
node index.js
```
3. The script will send messages to all recipients with a status of "pending" and update their status to "sent" upon successful delivery.

### Notes
- The script introduces a delay between message sends to comply with rate limiting and ensure reliability.
- Ensure compliance with WhatsApp's policies and terms of use when sending messages.
